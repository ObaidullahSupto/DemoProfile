<h3><a href="https://johnpistelli.com/" target="_blank">2. John Pistelli</a></h3>
<p>A professor at the University of Minnesota, blogger John Pistelli holds a
 PhD in English literature; he has published several works of fiction and poetry, 
 including a novel (Portraits and Ashes). The thoughtful, artful articles and musings 
 he shares with his followers aren't driven by hot topics or current events—they 
 are anchored by his personal interests in classic and contemporary fiction. This 
 book review blog features poetry, drama, and nonfiction, along with works of 
 various other genres. Readers can look forward to approximately one new review per week.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.bustle.com/books"target="_blank">3. Bustle Books</a></h3>
<p>Offering a take on the literary world centered around millennial women,
 Bustle Books' poignant think pieces and spotlight on the unexpected influences 
 of fanfiction provide a unique and meaningful perspective on the written word that
 will particularly speak to writing enthusiasts who grew up alongside the internet.</p>

<h3><a href="https://fromfirstpagetolast.com/"target="_blank">4.  From First Page to Last</a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://alifeinbooks.co.uk/"target="_blank">5. A Life in Books</a></h3>
<p>Blogger Susan Osborne has done it all—she has worked in book sales,
 as a writer, and as a magazine editor. As she puts it, her aims are to
 "select snippets of book news that interest [her], talk about some of the 
 books [she's] just read and alert readers to titles that might not find 
 themselves in the glare of the publicity spotlight." Look to this blog for
 topical book news, thoughtful reviews, lovingly selected recommendations,
 and other musings of a woman happily mired in the world of literature.</p>
